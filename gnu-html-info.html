<h2>GNU HTML-Info<br />
<small>(An HTML-Info viewer and tools)</small></h2>

<p><em>This project is hosted on
<a href="//savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnu-html-info">Savannah</a>.</em></p>

<p>HTML-Info is a definition of Info files with HTML. Tools built around
HTML-Info are intended to replace the current Info viewers. The intention
is for the GNU documentation format to be more easy to generate from other
tools, making documentation easier to build. Tools exist to build HTML
from markdown, creole, rst, perldoc, texinfo, etc&hellip; An HTML-based
Info viewer might be able to view all of these as a single documentation
unit.</p>

<p>HTML-Info does not exist yet, but what we have as output from the
existing tools is a good start. We will define the semantics of HTML-Info,
based on current HTML output, as we go.</p>
